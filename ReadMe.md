PbniHash
--------

PbniHash is a Powerbuilder PBNI extension that provides a hash table implementation to PB.

The hash table can hold any type of value, associated to a string key.
The object can be serialized into a blob (thanks to Nicolas Georges) so its contents can be saved and later restored (in another PB session).

This is free code, released under the MIT license with the hope that
it could be useful to someone else. There is absolutely NO WARRANTY.
Please read the license.txt for details.

PbniHash reuses the libhashish library that can be used under the BSD
license when the tree hashing algorithm is disabled.

Remarks, comments, questions and bug reports are welcome : drop me a
message at sebastien.kirche@free.fr

Please also drop me a note if you use that extension.
